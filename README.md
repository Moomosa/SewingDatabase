- **Thread** 🧵
  - Thread Type
  - Thread Color
  - Thread Color Family

- **Elastic** 🧼

## Project Structure

This solution is organized into three main components:

1. **Backend** 💾
   
   The backend of the application handles the core logic and data management. It's responsible for processing requests, interacting with databases, and ensuring the overall functionality of the application. In this project, you'll find server code, API endpoints, and any server-side functionality.

2. **Frontend** 🖥️

   The frontend is responsible for the user interface. It encompasses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other assets needed to create a user-friendly and visually appealing experience. 

3. **Model Library** 📚

   The Model Library consists of classes used to define and structure data for seamless communication between the frontend and backend. It plays a key role in how data is displayed and interacted with.


Feel free to explore each component for a deeper understanding of how the solution is organized and to access specific code and resources.

For more detailed information about each component or how they work together, feel free to explore the project directories. Comments and explanations are primarily available in the "Fabric" section of both the frontend and backend. While other areas may have limited comments, the "Fabric" section is a good starting point for understanding the code structure.

Happy sewing and inventory management!
